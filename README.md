# SexyScraper
I'm going to store any web-scraping scripts I write here. 

SexyScraper.py is a variation of a script I wrote to scrape information from a web-site about known processes. If you want to use the program, I suggest using the logic multiple jupyter notebook. First you need to sort the list of hyperlinks and then figure out how to split up the work. Based on my estimates, the program will take over 6 hours to run if it isn't split up.
